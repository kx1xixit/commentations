# Introduction to Commentations

Commentations is a simple commenting extension for TurboWarp. Ditch the vanilla Scratch comments and go full power-user!

## Key features

- **Inline commenting**: You can add TODOs, notes, and more to your projects for the sake of documentation.
- **Disabling code**: You can put code you want to disable in a C block, and it disables the code. You can specify a reason, too!

## Who is this for?

You!

If you're a Scratch developer and you feel burdened by the vanilla comment system, you can try Commentations and upgrade your projects.
